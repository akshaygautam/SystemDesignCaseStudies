# CDN: Content Delivery Network

It is a distributed network of servers strategically placed at various locations worldwide to deliver web content more 
efficiently to users. CDN providers cache static content, such as images, stylesheets, scripts and other large files, on
server close to the end-users, reducing latency and improving website performance.

## CDN Key Concepts

1. **Content Caching:**
   - CDNs cache static content at various edge locations around the globe. 
   - This means that when a user requests a resource, it is served from the nearest edge server.
   - Reducing the load on the origin server and improving load times.
2. **Reduced Latency:**
   - By serving content from servers closer to the end-users, CDNs reduce latency.
   - This is particularly important for websites with a global audience, as it minimized the time it takes for data to travel between the user's browser and the server.
3. **Load Balancing:**
   - CDNs can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. This load balancing helps maintain optimal performance and ensure high availability.
4. **Security:**
   - CDNs often provide security features such as DDoS protection, SSL/TSL termination, and Web Application (WAFs) to protect websites and applications from various cyber threat.
5. **Dynamic Content Accelerations:**
   - While CDNs are traditionally associated with caching static content, many modern CDNs also offer features for accelerating the delivery of dynamic content, such as personalized or database-driven content.
6. **Origin Shield:**
   - Some CDNs use an "origin shield" or "mid-tier cache" to reduce the load on the origin server. The intermediate layer of caching helps serve request to edge servers more efficiently.
7. **Cost Saving:**
   - CDNs can lead to cost savings for website owners by reducing the load on their origin servers. Since content is served from edge locations, the origin server handles fewer request, potentially lowering hosting costs.
8. **HTTP/2 and SPDY Support:**
   - CDNs often support modern protocols like HTTP/2 and SPDY, which further enhance the speed of content delivery by allowing multiple resources to be delivered in parallel over a single connection.
9. **Analytics and Reporting:**
   - Many CDNs offer analytics and reporting tools that provide insights into websites performance, user behaviour and traffic patterns.
   - These tools help website owners optimize their content delivery strategies.
10. **Streaming and Video Delivery:**
    - CDNs are widely used for streaming and delivering video content. They offer solutions for adaptive bitrate streaming, reducing buffering, and ensuring a smoother viewing experience for users.

# Caching Strategies and Content Persistence in CDNs

## Caching Strategies:

1. **Time-Based Expiration:**
   - CDNs often use time-based expiration to determine when cached content should be refreshed. Each cached asset is assigned a time-to-live (TTL) value, indicating how long it should be considered valid. Once the TTL expires, the CDN fetches a fresh copy of the content from the origin server.

2. **Cache Invalidation:**
   - Cache invalidation is the process of removing or updating cached content before its TTL expires. CDNs may use various techniques for cache invalidation, such as receiving explicit cache purge requests from website owners or automatically detecting changes in the content at the origin server.

3. **Dynamic Content Caching:**
   - While CDNs are traditionally associated with caching static content, many modern CDNs also support dynamic content caching. This involves caching and delivering dynamically generated content, such as personalized responses or content generated on-the-fly, more efficiently.

4. **Edge Side Includes (ESI):**
   - ESI is a markup language that enables dynamic content assembly at the edge server. CDNs supporting ESI can cache different parts of a web page separately and assemble them at the edge based on the user's request, allowing for a mix of static and dynamic content.

## Content Persistence:

1. **Edge Server Caches:**
   - CDNs maintain caches at their edge servers, which are strategically distributed worldwide. These edge server caches store copies of static content based on the caching strategies mentioned above.

2. **Distributed Cache Hierarchies:**
   - Some CDNs implement a distributed cache hierarchy, allowing for efficient content distribution across different layers of caches. This may include mid-tier caches (origin shields) and other layers to improve cache-hit rates and reduce the load on the origin server.

## Types of Caches:

1. **Full-Page Cache:**
   - CDNs often cache entire web pages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to reduce the need for repeated requests to the origin server. Full-page caching is effective for static or semi-static content.

2. **Object-Based Cache:**
   - Object-based caching involves caching individual assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) separately. Each asset has its own cache control settings, allowing for more granular control over expiration times.

3. **Byte-Range Cache:**
   - Byte-range caching allows CDNs to cache partial responses and serve only the portions of a file that are needed. This is particularly useful for large media files, where only a specific range of bytes may be required.

## Persistence Mechanisms:

1. **In-Memory Caching:**
   - Cached content is often stored in memory at edge servers for fast retrieval. In-memory caching allows for quick access to frequently requested assets.

2. **Disk-Based Caching:**
   - Some CDNs may use disk-based caching for less frequently accessed content or large files that may not fit entirely in memory. Disk-based caching provides more storage capacity but may have slightly higher latency.

3. **Solid-State Drive (SSD) Caching:**
   - CDNs may leverage SSDs for caching to improve read and write speeds. SSDs are faster than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and enhance overall cache performance.
